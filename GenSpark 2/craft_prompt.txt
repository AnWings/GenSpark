2)Diet Plan for a 240 lb, 6'0" Male
Step 1: Calculate Caloric Needs
Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) (Mifflin-St Jeor Equation)
𝐵𝑀𝑅=10×weight in kg+6.25×height incm− 5 × age+5
BMR=10×weight in kg+6.25×height in cm−5×age+5
Weight: 240 lbs (109 kg)
Height: 6'0" (183 cm)
Age: Approximate for calculation (e.g., 30 years)
𝐵𝑀𝑅≈10(109)+6.25(183)−5(30)+5=1090+1144−150+5=2089 kcal/day

BMR≈10(109)+6.25(183)−5(30)+5=1090+1144−150+5=2089 kcal/day
Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)
Based on activity level:

Sedentary (little exercise): 
𝐵𝑀𝑅 × 1.2 BMR×1.2 ≈ 2507 kcal
Lightly Active (1-3 workouts/week): 
𝐵𝑀𝑅 × 1.375
BMR×1.375 ≈ 2862 kcal
Moderately Active (4-5 workouts/week): 
𝐵𝑀𝑅 × 1.55
BMR×1.55 ≈ 3248 kcal
Very Active (6+ workouts/week): 
𝐵𝑀𝑅 × 1.725
BMR×1.725 ≈ 3600 kcal
Step 2: Goal-Oriented Caloric Intake
For Fat Loss (Cutting): TDEE - 500 kcal (~1 lb/week weight loss)
For Muscle Gain (Bulking): TDEE + 250-500 kcal
For Maintenance: TDEE
Example: If aiming for fat loss with moderate activity, target ~2700 kcal/day.

Step 3: Macronutrient Breakdown
A balanced ratio is:

Protein: 1g per pound of lean body mass (aim for ~180-200g)
Carbs: 40-50% of total calories
Fats: 20-30% of total calories
For 2700 kcal/day (Fat Loss Plan):

Protein: ~200g (800 kcal)
Carbs: ~275g (1100 kcal)
Fats: ~89g (800 kcal)
Step 4: Sample Meal Plan

Eternity Could Wait
The time had come to say goodbye, but Liam didnâ€™t want to let go.  Sixty-three years of marriage would do that to you.  He looked down on his wife, her eyes closed, her hands across her chest.  It almost brought tears to his eyes again.  He reached out and brushed her cheek.
Her eyes fluttered open.  She searched the room, but nope, her husband was still gone.  She was absolutely sure she had felt him.  She felt the tears well up again.  When will they ever stop?  She rolled over to cry silently into her pillow.  Why did he have to leave her?
He saw her look straight through him, not seeing his ghostly spirit.  He knew he should go on to whatever fate he had waiting, but well, sixty-three years of marriage.  Instead, he blew her a kiss and contented himself with watching over her.  Eternity could wait.
